# Consulting Club Case Competition Summary

## Summary
I have provided a script of my solution to the problem presented in the case competition. The competition took place over the course of two days – the first day involved getting to know the problem and formulating a strategy, while day two involved presenting our solution to the judges. Some data relating to the dry wall industry’s market share was provided. Other information provided includes the total number of competitors in the industry, and typical customer behavior. 

## Problem
An incoming low-cost competitor is entering the dry wall market, and our customer, the largest dry wall manufacturer in the country, must decide how to respond. 

## Assumptions

- Dry wall market is mature (been around for a while)
- Drywall competition is fierce (32 other competitors)
- Commodity, so low product differentiation
- Low price competitors are built on low cost operating costs, our operating costs are higher than theirs

## My Solution

Our goals are to:
- Secure own brand loyalty and image
- Increase profitability
- We do not want to focus on pricing or beating competitor out of the market. 

It’s mentioned in the case that customers prefer to stick to one brand. There are many existing competitors in the market already, and our company cannot pay attention to every single new player unless they offer a product or pricing that will radically affect consumer behavior, otherwise we’d constantly be reacting to the market. We should be aware of our customer's competitors, but shouldn’t always adjust according to our competitors since we have our own business structure in place. Moreover, we don’t want to get stuck up in a price war – this is because we are much bigger, so it’s harder for us to change our existing business mode, and this may not be a sustainable practice. Anyone can lower their price, but unless we plan to keep prices low it’s not a sustainable method for gaining new customers.

Therefore I believe that the best option is to focus on securing our own brand loyalty while acquiring more consumers from existing competitors.

There are a number of ways to do this - there are too many to count, so I won’t list them all. But because we are in the applied analytics program, I thought that the best method would be to utilize analytics in creating our recommendation.

There’s something called the 80/20 rule in sales – it states that 80% of your profit comes from 20% of your most loyal customers. There are both good and not so good customers. Customers who are easily drawn away by a lowered price are not our most profitable or loyal anyways and are more likely to be one-time purchasers.

My strategy is as follows:
- Using analytical techniques, we want to identify the most important or profitable customers through market analysis and various analytical techniques using data from the comapny's AIS.
- Determine what they value most (through interviews, various analytical techniques that look at reviews, and so on.)
- Tailor your products and services to meet their specific needs

Disadvantages:
- May limit appeal to wider audience
- May be costly to conduct market research and build analytical tools, especially if there is not a high analytical reliance in place.
- Results may go against the intuition of senior management. May be harder to convince people to go against their experience or desire to cut out compeition

Advantages:
- Build a more niche market by differentiating yourself and attract the right types of customers
- Avoid price wars and new entrants, other external competitive forces
- Word of mouth (no need for mass marketing)
- Become more profitable with the profitable customers
- Secure current customer loyalty

I believe that my proposed strategy provides an analytical approach to providing recommendations to the CEO. If we focus our efforts on analytically deriving the customers that matter most to us and keep coming back, then we reduce our risk of losing them to new entrants, existing competitors, and increase profitability.
